UFO Invasion
============

This is a very old project that I did when I was 15 (that's around 2005).
I was learning to use DirectDraw 7, just before getting started on D3D8
and 3D rendering stuff.

It was inspired in Chicken Invaders The Next Wave that came out a couple
years before. It features MIDI music, some pre-rendered 3D graphics, and
Photoshop rendered menu text.

The engine is based on VB6 and its Direct Draw 7 bindings (that IIRC are
native to VB6). Uses Direct Music to play MIDI files and experiments
with a custom data pack format.

Of course it's in spanish and most of the code is too :)
